## 2025 and 2024 AI art work submissions worthy of mention

### Not finished yet need to explore more !!

#### Simple AI Art Pieces

This section of art is very simple, hence good to look at 
to figure out why it got selected, looks mandane compared all the 
fancy art listed here so why was it choosen ?? 

can we do the same ?? 

no need to be super complex with tons of imbellishments to get in the door

but how ??? 

how to be simple and yet novel ???

1. **[Machine Gaze](https://thecvf-art.com/project/katie-morris-machine-gaze-2025/)** => This just a simple AI generated Image
was it selected due to its very relevant polical statement about dangers of a dystopian AI surveillance State ??? 

    Can we also apply this concept of digital corrupting and mutating the biological in the indian patterns ??? 
    since we already have the LoRa of pure tradition indian patterns, but the mixing in two concepts or changing the scales 
    we can also "corrupt"/"mutate" the Tradition Indian clothing Patterns 

    Even sarees, since that was the critique of the Saree LoRa is neither Saree nor western dress but a uncanny amalgamation of both ? 

    is the idea worth exploring ??? 

    does it hold water ???? 

    need feed back !!!!

2. **[Compositionality and Parts using SPICE](https://thecvf-art.com/project/compositionality-and-parts/)** => this is trying to prove a point by using a SPICE method that Gary Marcus is wrong about AI ability to handle novelty ?????

3. **[HyperArt](https://thecvf-art.com/project/sara-sisti-hyperart-2025/)** => a self protrait with some AI image transformations got in ??

4. **[The Meaning of, Mirror](https://thecvf-art.com/project/the-meaning-of-mirror/)** => mix the two kurta and saree lora to produce images with interesting aritifacts ??? 


### Best Candidates so far 

1. **[Habsburg AI Portrait Studies](https://thecvf-art.com/project/habsburg-ai-portrait-studies/)** => Model collapse—train AI recursively on its own output. Great for LoRA since fine-tuning is lightweight and doesn't need many images 

    but does this tell a tale ? 

    or its simple tech experiment for the curious ?? does it need a tale/story/philisophical dimension to stand out ??? 

    ie lacks a human connection, doesnt have a universal appeal, will only make sense to tech folks  

    How to add universal appeal or can it be added ???


2. **[Machine Gaze](https://thecvf-art.com/project/katie-morris-machine-gaze-2025/)** => Use LoRa scale and/or concept mixing to corrupt/mutate/ the traditional patterns or kurta/saree 

    technically very simple more on the philisophical spectrum 

    Will that be enough to get in ????
