### Best Candidates so far 

Model collapse, ie train ai on the its data recursively (feed the output as input repeatedly), like we have lora 
for indian patterns get 100 image 
then train it again on that then 
generate 100 image, 
apply the process again and again this great since fine tune is not computer heavy and 
doesnt need alot of images as well
